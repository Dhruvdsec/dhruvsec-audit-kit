# dhruvsec-audit-kit

Welcome to my personal smart contract security lab — **dhruvsec-audit-kit** 🛡️

This repo is my ongoing documentation of everything I learn while diving deep into the world of **Web3 security, Solidity, and smart contract auditing**.

From breaking contracts in CTFs to understanding EVM internals and real-world bug bounty writeups — this is where I’ll log it all.

> 🚀 I'm not just learning to audit — I'm building the mindset, tools, and skillset to **become one of the best in the game.**

> 💡 The goal? Not just to audit smart contracts, but to **understand them deeper than most developers ever will.**

Let’s turn bytecode into battle-tested knowledge — one vuln at a time ⚔️
