# 📘 Solidity Simplified

> Making Solidity so simple that even your non-tech dost can vibe with it 😎

Welcome to `Solidity Simplified` — my personal rewrite of the entire Solidity documentation, with a twist:  
**No fluff. No confusion. Just pure, understandable, real-world Solidity.**

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists
The official docs are detailed, but let’s be real — they read like a textbook sometimes.  
This section is for:
- Learners who want plain-English breakdowns
- Auditors who need deeper internal understanding
- Developers who wanna master the EVM, not just compile code

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `01-basics.md` | Variables, types, visibility — the foundation |
| `02-functions.md` | Function types, view/pure/payable, modifiers |
| `03-storage.md` | Memory vs Storage vs Calldata explained |
| `04-events-logs.md` | How contracts talk to the outside world |
| `05-inheritance.md` | Virtual, override, multiple inheritance |
| `06-security-pitfalls.md` | Reentrancy, integer issues, tx.origin, etc |
| `07-evm-behind-scenes.md` | Opcodes, gas, stack, storage layout |

---

## ⚡ Goal
To build the **most accessible, audit-ready Solidity guide on GitHub** — no nonsense, just nuggets.  
If it doesn’t click with me, I rewrite it until it does.

> 📌 This ain't a tutorial. This is documentation, **decoded**.
