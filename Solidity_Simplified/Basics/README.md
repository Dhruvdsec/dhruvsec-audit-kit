# 🧱 Solidity Basics — From Zero to Deploy 🚀

Welcome to the **Basics** section of `solidity-simplified` — where we go from knowing nothing about smart contracts to writing gas-efficient code like a pro.

This section covers the **absolute fundamentals** of Solidity in an easy-to-understand, audit-ready way.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- Write secure and readable Solidity code
- Understand how the EVM handles data and execution
- Avoid beginner pitfalls like misuse of `storage`, `tx.origin`, or `assert()`
- Deploy and test your own contracts confidently
